# Problem 6: Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists #

- Appending an item to the (modified) linked list has a time complexity of `O(1)`.
- Constructing a list of the values containing in a linked list has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of items in the list.
- The "union" operation has a time complexity of `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the number of items in the first list, and `m` is the number of items in the second list.
- The "intersection" operation has a time complexity of `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the number of items in the first list, and `m` is the number of items in the second list.
