# Problem 6: Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists #
Appending an item to the (modified) linked list has a time complexity of `O(1)`. Constructing a list of the values containing in a linked list has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of items in the list.

The "union" operation has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of items in the longest list.

The "intersection" operation has a worst-case time complexity of `O(nm)`, where `n` is the number of items in the shortest list, and `m` is the number of items in the longest list.

However, the _average_ time complexity of the `in` operation on a set is `O(1)`, making the average time complexity of the "intersection" operation `O(m)`.
