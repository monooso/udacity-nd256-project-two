# Problem 5: Blockchain #
The blockchain uses a simple linked list.

- The time complexity of creating the initial list is `O(n)`.
- The time complexity of adding an item to the blockchain is `O(1)`.
- The worst-case time complexity of locating an item within the blockchain is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of blocks in the blockchain.
- The space complexity of the blockchain is `O(n)`.
