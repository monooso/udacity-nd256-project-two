# Problem 4: Active Directory #
The solution does not use any data structures, other than those already defined as part of the question.

The time complexity of the user lookup is `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the total number of users, and `m` is the total number of groups.

The space complexity is `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the total number of users, and `m` is the total number of groups.
